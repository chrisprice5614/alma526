<p>Welcome to the latest episode of the Can You Feel So Now? blog series. Host Justin Barton sits down with Clay Smith, a former missionary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to discuss his transformative journey in the Barbados, Bridgetown Mission. Clay shares how his mission tested his faith, reshaped his perspective on humility, and deepened his connection to the people he served. Through cultural adaptation, personal trials, and a newfound love for language, his experience became a powerful lesson in growth and service.</p>
<h1>An Unexpected Encounter</h1>
<p>Clay, hailing from the quiet town of Snowflake, Arizona, shares how his upbringing framed a life surrounded by sports, the great outdoors, and community service. Despite leading what could be seen as an isolated existence, Clay was soon to encounter a world much larger and different than he had ever imagined.</p>
<h1>The Mission Call</h1>
<p>Clay recounts his call to serve in the Barbados, Bridgetown Mission, French-speaking in the West Indies. The prospect of leaving Snowflake for the colorful vibes and languages of the Caribbean was both daunting and exhilarating. Yet, it also brought its challenges—chief among them, a lesson in humility. Initially, Clay admits struggling with pride and a resistance to truly embrace the cultural differences. However, this set the stage for a profound transformation.</p>

<h1>Facing Cultural Shock</h1>
<p>Clay entered the mission field with a particularly strong American pride and a knowledge of his physical prowess. However, the stark cultural differences, including culinary and linguistic barriers, soon challenged his preconceptions. A turning point came when an elder, known for his discipline and humility, became Clay’s companion. Through patience and love, this elder taught Clay the importance of humility, urging him to open his heart to the people of the Caribbean.</p>
<h1>A Moment of Realization</h1>
<p>A pivotal moment in Clay’s journey was the passing of his grandmother, whose parting words were to "be obedient." During a crisis of faith and identity, Clay chose to humble himself, seeking guidance through fervent prayer and introspection. What followed was a sincere commitment to repentance and renewal, forever altering his perspective.
</p>
<h1>Language as a Gateway to Connection</h1>
<p>Another cornerstone of Clay’s mission experience was the extraordinary bond he achieved through language. Despite his initial struggles with French, an unexpected encounter with a Book of Mormon in Haitian Creole inspired a newfound passion for the language. Clay threw himself into learning Creole, using it to connect with Haitian immigrants in the Caribbean. This linguistic connection not only broke barriers but also kindled a deep love for the people he served.</p>
<h1>Embracing the Atonement of Jesus Christ</h1>
<p>Throughout his mission, Clay developed a profound testimony of the Book of Mormon and the principles of atonement and repentance. The power of scripture and the daily commitment to live his faith transformed his understanding of what it means to follow Christ. Repentance became more than a series of steps; it was a daily choice to carry his cross and strive for spiritual improvement.</p>
<h1>Experiences of Faith and Humility</h1>
<p>Clay shares a couple of impactful stories that reinforced his newfound humility and faith. A particularly moving encounter was with Nelly, a woman initially resistant to the missionaries. Through persistence and spiritual witness, Nelly experienced a remarkable transformation, leading her to open her heart to the gospel. </p>
<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>
<p>Justin Barton closes the podcast with reflections on the essential practice of remembering one’s spiritual journey, emphasizing the importance of continual growth and self-evaluation. The discussion serves as a reminder of the profound impact a mission can have on one’s life and the enduring lessons learned through service, humility, and faith.</p>
