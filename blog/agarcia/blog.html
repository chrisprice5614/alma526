<p>Serving under two mission presidents, Alaya gained valuable insights. The first emphasized obedience and baptism, urging missionaries to "repent at the speed of thought." This instilled in Alaya the importance of striving for exactness in her faith. The second president focused on the doctrine of Christ and lifelong discipleship, teaching Alaya the importance of continuously applying gospel principles in daily life.</p>
