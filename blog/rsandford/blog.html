    <p>In the latest episode of the "Can You Feel So Now?" podcast, host Justin Barton sits down with Ryan Sanford, a recently returned missionary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with an inspiring story of faith and transformation. Raised in a musical family in Kansas City, Ryan's path has been anything but conventional, leading him from music to business, from Kansas to Utah, and ultimately, to a profound connection with his faith.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>A Journey of Faith and Friendship</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ryan's journey began in high school when he met two lifelong friends, Sawyer and Charlie, whose faith and companionship left an indelible mark on him. Despite not growing up in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Ryan found himself drawn to the gospel principles his friends embodied. His hunger for meaning led him to embrace Christianity, and eventually, he joined the Church, a decision catalyzed by the transformative impact of a $1 book at a rummage sale&mdash;Stephen Covey's "Seven Habits of Highly Effective People."</p>

    <p><strong>Missionary Experiences in Texas</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ryan's mission in the Texas Houston South Mission was a period of immense growth. He's candid about the challenges, particularly around avoiding vain repetition and embracing unique scripture study. One of his most profound experiences involved mentoring a fellow missionary who was on the verge of returning home. Through empathy and understanding, Ryan and his companions were able to help this elder find strength and purpose, a testament to the power of charity and service.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Lessons on Personal Growth</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Throughout his mission, Ryan embarked on several personal fasts, including a compelling 40-day fast with a focus on eliminating distractions and optimizing his spiritual journey. This practice of introspection and dedication helped him forge a stronger connection with God and reinforced his commitment to living an intentional life. Ryan reflects on the balance of holding oneself to high standards while being merciful, recognizing the gift of each new day as an opportunity to improve and grow.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>The Principles of Righteousness</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For Ryan, the Gospel is fundamentally about principles&mdash;righteousness, virtue, courage, and nobility. His reflections on Doctrine and Covenants Section 121 underscore the dangers of unrighteous dominion and the necessary strive for virtue in all endeavors. These insights are not just theoretical but are seen in the way Ryan has structured his life post-mission.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Building the Kingdom on Earth</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ryan's professional aspirations are tightly intertwined with his spiritual commitments. While he pursues ambitious entrepreneurial goals, his ultimate vision is to use his success to further the work of God. This altruistic perspective drives his work in tech and entrepreneurship with the intention to contribute significantly, perhaps even pivoting to philanthropy.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Final Reflections and a Call to Action</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ryan&rsquo;s testimony of living life with intention and the power of self-reflection serves as a powerful reminder of what it means to change one's heart. In our fast-paced world, he emphasizes the importance of remaining focused on serving God and staying rooted in principles that define true character. For him, life is about the small and simple things, iterated daily to ensure a consistent walk in faith and purpose.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As we strive to navigate our own paths, his journey stands as an inspiring testament to the transformative power of faith, friendship, and intentional living. Whether you're exploring your spiritual path or seeking professional fulfillment while maintaining integrity and service, Ryan's story encourages us all to prioritize what truly matters.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Reflect on your own journey&mdash;what principles guide your life? How can you live with intention today and every day?</p>
