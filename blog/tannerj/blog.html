<p>In an engaging episode of the "Can You Feel So Now" podcast, host Justin Barton sat down for a heartfelt conversation with Tanner Johnson, a young, recently-returned missionary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, whose experiences provide inspiring insight into personal growth, faith, and service. Tanner, who hails from Queen Creek, Arizona, shared his journey from the bustling streets of New York City to the serene landscapes of Jamaica, shedding light on the transformative power of faith and perseverance.</p>

    A Family Story and Personal Growth

<p>Raised in a dynamic household with six siblings, Tanner learned early on the value of adaptability and harmony. This upbringing proved invaluable when, as a missionary, he needed to connect with diverse communities. Tanner started with hobbies like running and swimming, which grounded his sense of discipline, something that would later be crucial in his missionary work.</p>
<h1>The Unexpected Journey: New York City</h1>

<p>Tanner's missionary journey began unpredictably. Due to visa delays, he was reassigned to New York City before reaching his original destination of Jamaica. There, amidst the frenetic city pace, Tanner's mission president introduced a theme that would resonate deeply: "launching your nets out in the deep." This call to reach out and invite as many as possible resonated with Tanner, shaping his approach to missionary work and life. </p>
<h1>Patience and Understanding in Jamaica</h1>

<p>Once in Jamaica, Tanner faced a stark contrast to his New York experience. With fewer people to minister to and church meetings conducted beneath the open sky, the challenges were significant yet rewarding. This environment taught him resilience, the importance of humility, and appreciation for the simple joys in life, such as community gatherings and self-reliance, often exemplified by locals who managed on limited resources but exuded genuine happiness.</p>
<h1>Personal Transformation and Lasting Impact</h1>

<p>Throughout his mission, Tanner's initial insecurities were gradually replaced by confidence, largely due to his growing understanding of prayer and communication with God. This transformation was evident upon returning home, surprising his family with newfound extroversion and openness.</p>
<h1>Lessons in Contentment and Faith</h1>

<p>Tanner observed that true joy does not depend on circumstances but rather on life's focus, echoing President Nelson's philosophy, “The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives, and everything to do with the focus of our lives”. His experiences taught him contentment, emphasizing gratitude and trust in God's plan, even when immediate results weren't visible. Tanner learned to see challenges as opportunities for growth rather than obstacles meant to block his path.</p>
<h1>Living the Gospel Beyond the Mission</h1>
<p>Tanner now carries his mission lessons into daily life, ready to serve and share his faith. Although new to this phase, he's set on leading by example for his siblings, maintaining habits formed during missionary work. He advises those considering similar paths: "Just do it because it's the most wonderful experience you'll have."</p>
<h1>Conclusion: Continual Progress and Persistence</h1>

<p>Tanner's story is one of persistence, faith, and self-discovery. His mission taught him that setbacks are truly set-ups for something greater and that consistent prayer and pushing forward yield amazing outcomes. As an advocate for service and self-improvement, Tanner's journey stands as a testament to how deeply a dedicated heart can be changed through love and commitment to others.

    In his closing testimony, Tanner emphasizes the significance of charity, love for others, and the impact of embodying these virtues in daily life. His message is clear: through love and perseverance, we can transform our own lives and those around us, proving that with faith, even the most daunting challenges can lead to profound personal growth.
