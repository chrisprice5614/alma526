<p><b>Meeting Elizabeth Carey</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elizabeth begins by introducing herself&mdash;hailing from Spokane, Washington, after many relocations inherent to her Navy family background. Despite such moves, her experiences in San Diego left a significant impact, particularly during high school. Elizabeth highlights how staying in one place during those formative years helped solidify her faith and connections, particularly through seminary, where she found mentors who inspired her spiritual journey.</p>

<p><b>Discovering Faith and Agency</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A critical turning point for Elizabeth was realizing the importance of her personal agency in developing her faith. From a young age, her older sister&rsquo;s dedication to serving a mission inspired her, but it was at the age of 15, upon receiving her patriarchal blessing, that Elizabeth felt a deep personal calling to serve. This pivotal moment painted the path of choice, a theme that would resonate throughout her life and mission.</p>

<p><b>Lessons from the Mission Field</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s mission offered profound lessons on obedience and spiritual growth. She shares how her mission evolved with a shift in mission presidents&mdash;from a focus on exact obedience to embracing the spirit of the law. These experiences broadened her understanding of God&rsquo;s teachings and deepened her personal commitment to live by faith&rsquo;s spirit rather than its letter alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A memorable lesson occurred during a service project where she broke protocol by riding an ATV, prioritizing immediate needs over strict rules. The experience, with the reassurance of her mission president, reinforced the principle of serving God&rsquo;s children while exercising sound judgment and listening to the Spirit.</p>

<p>For Elizabeth, lifelong discipleship means choosing daily to serve, learn, and grow in the teachings of Jesus Christ. Her experiences on the mission field, especially during testing times, cemented her dedication to faith, emphasizing the principle of trust in God and the power of consistent effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She cites crucial experiences where her testimony was tested, including deep questions about her understanding of Jesus Christ and how it impacted her mission. Through prayer and rigorous study, Elizabeth solidified her why&mdash;living the gospel because of love, a love that extends from Heavenly Father to each of His children.</p>
