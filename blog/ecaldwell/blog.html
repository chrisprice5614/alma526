<p>Welcome to the "Can You Feel So Now?" podcast blog, where today we share an inspiring conversation between host Justin Barton and Emma Caldwell, a young woman who recently returned from her mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in the Arkansas, Bentonville Mission. Through her journey from a challenging upbringing to becoming a beacon of hope and faith, Emma's story is a testament to resilience, transformation, and the power of the gospel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;From a Broken Home to a Loving Family</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emma Caldwell begins by sharing her upbringing, a story familiar yet unique. Raised in Montana within a broken family, she grappled with abuse and neglect. However, she found solace and a sense of belonging with her adoptive family in Utah, which changed her perspective and anchored her life around faith and love. Although technically not adopted, Emma considers them family, having met them when she was a high school senior in a seemingly divinely orchestrated summer job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A Path to the Gospel</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emma&rsquo;s journey towards faith was spurred by seemingly small yet powerful interactions. A high school friend, who Emma initially found annoyingly bright, invited Emma to attend seminary classes. There, Emma encountered the Doctrine and Covenants, a revelation that introduced her to the idea of personal conversations with God&mdash;a stark contrast to her feelings of being unloved by her earthly parents.</p>

<p>Despite being baptized at around age 14 or 15, Emma faltered in her faith, influenced by her environment and the internet. It wasn't until her senior year that she met missionaries whose similar stories inspired her to serve a mission, despite familial threats of being cut off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Decision to Serve</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emma's decision to serve was not straightforward. She faced significant opposition from her non-believing parents and questioned her worthiness for God's love. Nonetheless, the impact of a sister missionary's story, her faith, and experiences like the teachings in her patriarchal blessing, helped her see the importance of serving&mdash;not just for herself, but for her future family.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Lessons from the Field</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Called to the Arkansas Bentonville Mission from June 2023 to January 2025, Emma's mission was both a blessing and a trial. Emma quickly found her personal struggles mirrored in those she taught. Her heart was profoundly affected by those who, like her, believed they were undeserving of love. Yet, through the spirit and interactions, she began to understand that "self-worth" in God&rsquo;s eyes surpasses all earthly afflictions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Healing Through Service</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emma shares how teaching others healed her own wounds. Through people like Jeff, who battled addiction but found hope through priesthood blessings Emily witnessed firsthand how the gospel transforms lives and reiterated that nobody is beyond the reach of Christ&rsquo;s Atonement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Growth Beyond Trials</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trials on her mission taught Emma that perseverance builds faith and resilience. Even homecoming challenges became opportunities for reflection and growth. Across the mission field, Emma likened wanderings to a spiritual refining fire, echoing Christ's own disciples who suffered yet thrived through divine purpose.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Embracing the Future</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, returned from her mission, Emma focuses on applying her learned principles: intentional living, focused prayer, and the covenants made with God. She emphasizes the importance of knowing one's divine identity and urges others to keep striving, anchored by Christ&rsquo;s redemptive love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Conclusion</p>

<p>Emma's journey is a profound testament to the transformative power of the gospel. Her experiences illustrate how adversity entwined with faith can forge steadfast discipleship. Her story is a call to all&mdash;whether contemplating a mission, enduring life&rsquo;s trials, or basking in spiritual joy&mdash;to embrace their identity in Christ and know they are loved beyond measure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emma Caldwell's journey from a broken home to a life of profound faith inspires us to ask ourselves: can we feel so now? If you've felt that change in heart or long to feel the "Song of Redeeming Love," may Emma's story inspire you to explore your path of transformation.</p>
