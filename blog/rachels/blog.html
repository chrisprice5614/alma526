Justin Barton sat down with Rachel Stumm, a recently-returned missionary of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who shared her inspiring journey of
faith, courage, and personal growth. Rachel's story is a testament to the power
of trusting in Christ and using our agency to navigate life's uncertainties.</span></p>

<p  ><span
>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p  ><span
>From
Spokane, Washington, Rachel's journey began with her decision to embark on a
mission to serve the Lord which evolved in ways she hadn't expected. Initially
called to serve in the Michigan, Lansing Mission, circumstances led her to
complete her service as a service missionary in Spokane, Washington. Rachel
candidly shared her journey through unexpected changes, the struggles she
faced, and her faith in God's plan.</span></p>

<p  ><span
>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p  ><span
>Rachel's
journey was not without its challenges. She spoke about her struggles with
mental health and the lessons she learned through her mission experience. Her
story highlights the courage it takes to let go of personal desires and allow
God to guide her path. Rachel found peace and joy in accepting the call to
serve in a way that was unconventional but deeply fulfilling.</span></p>

<h1><b><span
>The Role
of Courage</span></b></h1>

<p  ><span
>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p  ><span
>Throughout
the podcast, Rachel emphasized the importance of courage in her mission. For
her, courage meant allowing God to use her gifts for His work. Despite having
dealt with mental health issues, her mission taught her that courage involves a
willingness to step out of comfort zones and trust in the Lord's plan.</span></p>

>Learning
to Trust and Find Certainty in Christ</span></b></h1>

<p  ><span
>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p  ><span
>Rachel's
experience taught her the significance of acting with faith even when certainty
seemed elusive. Through moments of loneliness and self-doubt, she found herself
learning to trust in Jesus Christ as the constant in her life. Her story
illustrates how repeated acts of trust can lead to profound certainty and
assurance in one's faith journey.</span></p>

<h1 ><b><span
>The
Power of Consecration and Agency</span></b></h1>

<p  ><span
>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p  ><span
>One of
the pivotal lessons Rachel shared was the transformative power of agency and
consecration. She shed light on how missionary work, for her, became a
reflection of her authentic self, using her natural talents and gifts to bless
others. Rachel's insights remind us that by consecrating our time and efforts,
we allow God to work miracles through us, even when the path is unclear.</span></p>

navigate life's ups and downs. With humility and gratitude, she has embraced
the role of Christ in her life, fostering a deeper, more lasting joy.</span></p>
